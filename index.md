## What I Do

I help businesses turn **data, marketing spend, and complexity** into **clear decisions and measurable growth**.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- AI & Data Science
- Marketing Measurement
- Business Strategy

No hype. No black-box promises. Only what works in the real world.

### Advanced Marketing Analytics, Attribution & ROI Measurement

## What I Do

I help businesses **understand what truly drives revenue** by building rigorous, decision-grade analytics systems.

If you’re spending heavily on marketing but still asking:

- Which channels actually work?
- Are we scaling profitably or just scaling spend?
- Can we trust our ROAS numbers?

You’re in the right place.
