# Turn Marketing Spend into Measurable Growth

### Advanced Marketing Analytics, Attribution & ROI Measurement  
*For founders and marketing teams who want clarity—not dashboard noise.*

---

## What I Do

I help businesses **understand what truly drives revenue** by building rigorous, decision-grade analytics systems.

If you’re spending heavily on marketing but still asking:

- Which channels actually work?
- Are we scaling profitably or just scaling spend?
- Can we trust our ROAS numbers?

You’re in the right place.
