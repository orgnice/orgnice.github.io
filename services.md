    MMM helps quantify the true impact of marketing channels by accounting for lag, saturation, and external factors. It is most useful when attribution data is incomplete or biased.

    **Outcome**
    
    - Build statistically sound MMMs
    - Control for seasonality & macro effects
    - Simulate budget reallocation scenarios

    **Why It Matters**

    MMM helps leadership teams answer budget questions with confidence rather than intuition.
