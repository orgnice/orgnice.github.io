    <strong>Marketing Mix Modeling</strong><br><br>
    MMM helps quantify the true impact of marketing channels by accounting for lag, saturation, and external factors.<br><br>
    It is most useful when attribution data is incomplete or biased.

  ### What We Do
  
  <div class="sticky-main" markdown="1">
  - Build statistically sound MMMs
