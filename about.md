# About Us

We have 20+ years of experience across:

- Software & Data Engineering
- Data Science & Statistical Modeling
- Marketing Analytics & Measurement Consulting

we specialize in helping teams **cut through conflicting metrics** and build analytics they can trust.

Our focus is simple:
> Analytics should reduce confusion—not create new jargon.

We’ve led data science teams, built end-to-end systems, and partnered closely with marketing and leadership teams to turn insights into action.
