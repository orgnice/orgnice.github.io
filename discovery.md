# Discovery & Proposal Process

Before jumping into solutions, I prefer a **structured discovery conversation**.

This helps both sides decide if there’s a strong fit.

---

## What We Cover in the Discovery Call

- Your business model & growth stage
- Current analytics & data setup
- Key challenges in measurement or decision-making
- What success looks like for you

---

## What You Get

- Clear problem framing
- Honest feasibility assessment
- Suggested approach (even if we don’t work together)
- High-level engagement plan if applicable

---

## What This Is

- Not a sales pitch
- Not a generic demo
- Not a rushed call
